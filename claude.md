Whenever you're comparing the behavior of the application to the tests, and the tests fail. Always determine what the test is supposed to be testing for, and how the application code itself might not be representative of that. Do not adjust any of the tests themselves, but rather write a full description of what it's testing, and then try to re-design the application code to match that.

Ask as many clarifying questions as you can - Prefer to ask more than less.
